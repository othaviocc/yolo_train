# Calibration

Back to [[Hydrone]]. How to calibrate the belly camera — the one that decides
**where the drone lands**. It has no
depth: `pad_map_node` turns a pad's pixel position into a place in the world by
projecting through the `camera_info` this camera publishes. Until it is
calibrated that `camera_info` is a *guess* — a nominal 60° pinhole with zero
distortion and a perfectly centred sensor — and every pad position inherits the
error.

`down_cam_usb_node` says so once a second while `calibrated` is false. This
document is how to make it stop.

## What you need

| | |
|---|---|
| target | a **ChArUco** board — a chessboard with an ArUco marker in each white square. `camera_calibration` supports chessboard, circles, acircles and charuco; it does **not** support a plain ArUco grid |
| the board's four numbers | squares across × down, checker size, marker size, dictionary. A calib.io board prints all four along its bottom edge |
| a flat mount | see [[Calibration#Flatness, and the error nobody looks for|§5]] — this is the largest error source and the easiest to get wrong |
| a display | the calibrator is a GUI. Use the Jetson's own monitor, or `ssh -X` |

The board in use here reads:

```
www.calib.io | 11x9 | Checker Size: 22 mm | Marker Size: 16 mm | Dictionary: AruCo DICT_4X4
```

which becomes `--size 9x11 --square 0.022 --charuco_marker_size 0.016
--aruco_dict 4x4_250`. Two of those need explaining, and both are traps.

### `--size` counts SQUARES for charuco, not interior corners

For `-p chessboard` the size is the number of **interior corners** — the
familiar `8x6` for a 9×7 board. For `-p charuco` it is the number of
**squares**. `cameracalibrator.py:150` passes the pair straight into
`cv2.aruco.CharucoBoard`, and `calibrator.py:125` then expects `(x-1)*(y-1)`
corners from it. Pass interior corners here and the board is simply never
detected — no error, no warning, the GUI just never registers a sample and it
looks like a camera or lighting fault.

Note also that the printed `11x9` is rows × columns, while `--size` is
**columns × rows**. Run the probe ([[Calibration#Check the numbers before you spend twenty minutes waving a board|§2]]) rather than trusting either the label or
your own counting.

### `--aruco_dict` has its own spelling

`cameracalibrator` accepts only `aruco_orig`, `4x4_250`, `5x5_250`, `6x6_250`,
`7x7_250`. A board printed from `DICT_4X4_50` still works with `4x4_250`,
because OpenCV's predefined dictionaries are nested — the first 50 markers of
`DICT_4X4_250` *are* `DICT_4X4_50`.

---

## Check the numbers before you spend twenty minutes waving a board

```bash
# hold the board in front of the belly camera, then:
docker run --rm --privileged -v /dev:/dev -v $PWD:/repo -w /repo \
  hydrone-jetson:humble \
  python3 scripts/charuco_probe.py --save /repo/probe.png
```

It reports which dictionary detects markers, which `--size` is right, and
prints the exact `cameracalibrator` command. It exists because every one of
those parameters fails **silently** when wrong.

It does *not* pick `--size` by corner count, which cannot tell `9x11` from
`11x9` — both give `(9-1)*(11-1) = 80`. It fits a **homography** from each
candidate's object points to the detected image points. The board is planar, so
the correct layout fits to a fraction of a pixel and a transposed one scrambles
the correspondence entirely. Measured on a synthetic board: **0.268 px** for
`9x11` against **111.013 px** for `11x9`.

Self-test without a camera or a board:

```bash
python3 -c "import cv2; d=cv2.aruco.Dictionary_get(cv2.aruco.DICT_4X4_250); \
  cv2.imwrite('/tmp/synth.png', \
  cv2.aruco.CharucoBoard_create(9,11,0.022,0.016,d).draw((640,780)))"
python3 scripts/charuco_probe.py --image /tmp/synth.png
```

---

## Run it

```bash
./scripts/jetson_up.sh --calibrate
```

That starts the belly camera and the calibrator GUI together, with the board
parameters above already filled in (override with `CAL_SIZE`, `CAL_SQUARE`,
`CAL_MARKER`, `CAL_DICT` in the environment for a different target).

It deliberately does **not** use `sources_real.launch.py`, which would also
start the ZED, its depth computation and MAVROS. On a Tegra X1 that is most of
the CPU, and the calibrator wants frames promptly or the GUI feels broken.

### Where the window appears, and the cookie that stops it

`--calibrate` passes `$DISPLAY` through and mounts the X cookie. Two routes
work: the Jetson's own screen (`DISPLAY=:0`), or `ssh -X` from your desk
(`DISPLAY=localhost:10.0`, reachable because the container is on `--network
host`).

The cookie is the part that bites. `$HOME/.Xauthority` is very often **stale** —
on this board it was two months old and held cookies for a display that no
longer existed. The symptom is

```
Invalid MIT-MAGIC-COOKIE-1 key
cv2.error: ... Can't initialize GTK backend in function 'cvInitSystem'
```

which reads like missing X libraries rather than an authorisation failure. The
script therefore asks the running X server which `-auth` file it was started
with (`ps -o args= -C Xorg`) instead of guessing; here that is
`/run/user/1000/gdm/Xauthority`. If it still fails, `xhost +local:` on whichever
machine owns the display.

`--no-service-check` because `down_cam_usb_node` takes its intrinsics as ROS
**parameters** and offers no `set_camera_info` service. The calibrator's
**COMMIT** button therefore does nothing useful here; use **SAVE**, which
writes `/tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz`, and copy the numbers out by hand ([[Calibration#Feeding the numbers back|§4]]).

That file is written **inside the container**, which runs with `--rm`. Copy it
out from a second terminal *before* stopping the GUI:

```bash
docker cp hydrone-jetson:/tmp/calibrationdata.tar.gz .
```

Run the GUI **on the Jetson**, not on a laptop subscribing over the network:
the board is on wifi, and `/down_cam/image_raw` at 640×480×3 × 15 Hz is about
110 Mbit/s.

### Filling the coverage bars

The GUI shows X, Y, Size and Skew. All four must go green before **CALIBRATE**
lights up, and each one is a distinct kind of motion:

* **X / Y** — board at the left, right, top and bottom edges of the frame.
  This is what pins the principal point `cx, cy`.
* **Size** — board close, and board far. This is what separates focal length
  from distance; without it `fx, fy` are poorly determined.
* **Skew** — board tilted, not square-on. Tilt it around both axes, 30–45°.

Two things specific to this camera:

* The C270 is **fixed focus** and will not resolve anything closer than roughly
  40 cm. Its "close" is about 40–50 cm, not 10.
* Calibrate at the **resolution you fly at** — 640×480 here. `fx, fy, cx, cy`
  scale with resolution, so a 1280×720 calibration is wrong at 640×480 unless
  you scale it yourself.

Aim for 40+ samples spread over the frame, not 40 of the same pose.

---

## The fast route: capture here, solve there

The GUI does capture and solve in one process on the machine holding the
camera, and on a Tegra X1 the solve is the problem. Measured 2026-08-22: **26+
minutes and still running**, GUI frozen throughout, because
`camera_calibrator.py:298` calls `do_calibration()` straight from the mouse
callback — the same thread as `cv2.imshow`. The identical solve on a desktop
i7 took **0.9 s**.

Splitting the two also keeps the images. A GUI calibration that goes wrong has
to be re-waved from scratch; a directory of frames can be re-solved as often as
you like.

```bash
# on the Jetson -- no GUI, no solve, just frames
docker run --rm --privileged -v /dev:/dev -v $PWD:/repo -w /repo \
  hydrone-jetson:humble python3 scripts/capture_charuco.py --out /repo/cal_imgs

# copy them somewhere fast
scp -r jetson@192.168.0.102:~/cbr2026/joao_pessoa_2026/cal_imgs .

# solve, in about a second
python3 scripts/calibrate_offline.py --images cal_imgs
```

`capture_charuco.py` bins each view by where the board sits in frame, how much
of the frame it fills and how far it is tilted, keeping only frames that land in
a bin still short of views. That is the same idea as the GUI's X/Y/Size/Skew
bars, printed as a table.

V4L2 capture is **exclusive**, so if something already holds the camera — a
running calibrator, or `jetson_up.sh --sources` — pass
`--from-topic /down_cam/image_raw` instead and it subscribes rather than opening
the device. Verified: 244 frames received in 20 s from a second container while
a calibration solve was running in the first.

`calibrate_offline.py` works out `--size` and the legacy-pattern flag by
homography residual rather than trusting either. It was checked against ground
truth by rendering ChArUco views through a known camera: `fx` 560 → 558.91,
`cx` 322.0 → 322.10.

### The live view, and the axis that stays thin

```bash
python3 scripts/capture_charuco.py --show --out cal_imgs
```

`--show` opens a window with the detections drawn, the current **tilt in
degrees**, a gauge marked at 30, and a line naming what is still missing
(`need: EDGES, CLOSE+FAR, TILT>30 (0/8)`). Seeing what the camera sees is most
of what the ROS GUI was providing; the tilt angle is the part that GUI does not
show, and tilt was the axis that silently stayed thin here.

The C270 is a USB webcam, so the easiest way to do all this is to **unplug it
from the drone and plug it into a real computer**: a display, a fast solve, and
a camera you can hold. Intrinsics belong to the camera, not the host, so the
result transfers back to the Jetson unchanged — provided the **resolution and
pixel format match** what the drone runs (640x480 MJPG). Verify that rather
than assume it; some UVC cameras crop rather than scale at lower resolutions,
which changes the focal length in pixels.

**Tilt cannot be obtained by moving around a board lying on a table.** With the
target flat and the camera above it, every view is fronto-parallel however much
the camera translates. Measured on a real 41-view set captured that way: median
tilt 7 degrees, maximum 22.7, and **not one view past 30**. Either hold the
board at an angle or hold the camera at one.

### The legacy pattern, and when it matters

OpenCV 4.6 changed which squares of a ChArUco board carry markers. A board
printed to the old convention and detected under 4.6+ **without**
`setLegacyPattern(True)` maps its corner IDs to the wrong object points — it
still detects, still calibrates, and returns a plausible wrong answer. This
matters here because the Jetson image has OpenCV 4.5.4 (legacy only) while a
desktop is likely on 4.11.

For a **9×11** board it happens not to bite: legacy and new generate
byte-identical images *and* identical object points. It does bite boards with an
even dimension. `calibrate_offline.py` scores both regardless.

---

## Feeding the numbers back

The calibrator prints a YAML block. What matters:

```yaml
camera_matrix:                  distortion_coefficients:
  data: [fx,  0, cx,              data: [k1, k2, p1, p2, k3]
          0, fy, cy,
          0,  0,  1]
```

Pass them to the launch:

```bash
./scripts/jetson_up.sh \
    down_cam_calibrated:=true \
    down_cam_fx:=<fx> down_cam_fy:=<fy> \
    down_cam_cx:=<cx> down_cam_cy:=<cy>
```

and once you are happy, edit the defaults in
`src/hydrone_bringup/launch/sources_real.launch.py` so they survive without
being retyped. The once-a-second warning stops when `calibrated` is true, which
is the confirmation that the node took them.

### Reprojection error does not tell you the calibration is right

This is the trap that cost the most time here, so it is worth stating plainly.

A real 13-view set from this C270 solved to **0.4866 px** — comfortably "good"
by that measure — and returned

```
fx 108.848  fy 111.468  cx 312.822  cy 27.950
```

`fx = 108.8` at 640 px wide implies a **142 degree** lens. The C270 is about
60°, which needs `fx` near 554. And `cy = 28` puts the optical centre 28 px from
the top edge instead of near 240. The numbers were wrong by 5x and the error
metric was happy.

Reprojection error measures how well the model fits *the views you gave it*.
When those views share one distance and one part of the frame, focal length and
depth trade off against each other: a lens 5x too short, at a distance 5x too
near, lands the corners on almost the same pixels. The fit is excellent and the
lens is fiction. No amount of staring at that number reveals it.

`calibrate_offline.py` therefore checks the answer against what a camera can
physically be — implied FOV against the nominal, principal point against the
image centre, `fx/fy` against square pixels — and **refuses to print launch
arguments** for an implausible result, exiting 2 instead. Printing them was the
real hazard: they are copy-pasteable and nothing downstream would question them.
`--expect-hfov` sets the nominal for a different camera; `0` disables the check.

The cure is coverage, not more frames of the same:

* the board at all four **corners** of the frame — fixes `cx`, `cy`
* the board **close and far** — separates focal length from depth
* the board **tilted 30–45°** — constrains distortion

`coverage: position n/9  size n/3  tilt n/2`, printed before the solve, is the
thing to watch. The rejected calibration above had `position 4/9`.

A good result has reprojection error below ~0.5 px at 640×480 **and** passes
the sanity check. Above ~1.0 px, something else is wrong — usually [[Calibration#Flatness, and the error nobody looks for|§5]].

---

## Flatness, and the error nobody looks for

A calibration target is assumed to be **perfectly planar**. Paper is not. A
sheet taped at the corners bows in the middle by a few millimetres, which on a
22 mm square is a several-percent geometric error, and the solver absorbs it
into the distortion coefficients — where it looks like a plausible answer
rather than a mistake.

Glue the print to glass, acrylic, or dibond. Foam board and cardboard warp with
humidity. Tape at the edges only is not enough. If you can see the print lift
anywhere when you look across it at a shallow angle, fix that before you start.

**Print scale, by contrast, does not matter for what we need.** Scaling the
object points uniformly scales only the translation vectors; `fx, fy, cx, cy`
and the distortion coefficients come out identical. So a printer that scaled
the page to 97% costs nothing here — measure the squares anyway, it is free,
but do not redo a calibration over it.

---

## Checking it afterwards

```bash
ros2 run camera_calibration cameracheck --size 9x11 --square 0.022 \
    monocular:=/down_cam image:=/down_cam/image_raw
```

Then the check that actually matters for this drone: put a pad at a known place
on the floor, hover over it, and compare what `pad_map_node` publishes on
`/hydrone/pads/markers` against a tape measure. Intrinsics that look good and a
mount transform that is wrong produce a confident, repeatable, wrong answer —
and `down_cam_mount_xyz` / `down_cam_mount_rpy_deg` are still at BiguaSim's
virtual airframe values. See [[Jetson Real Stack#Not ready yet — read before flying|§9]].
