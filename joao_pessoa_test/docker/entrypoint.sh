# The biguasim package (BiguaSim client + ArduPilot bridge runner) lives in
# the bs-drone-competition repo, mounted read-only by docker-compose. It is
# installed on first container start; the copy to a temp dir keeps pip from
# writing build artifacts into the mounted (host) repo.
#
# Keyed on the CONTENT of pyproject.toml rather than on whether biguasim
# imports. "Is it installed?" goes stale the moment the package gains a
# dependency: biguasim itself still imports, the install is skipped, and the
# new dependency is never fetched. That is exactly how `import zmq` came to
# fail after biguasim gained pyzmq -- the symptom points at the node, and the
# cause is a guard that answered a question nobody was asking.
