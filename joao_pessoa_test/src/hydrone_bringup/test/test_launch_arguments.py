"""
A sim wrapper must not re-declare the arguments of the launch file it includes.

This pins a bug that cost a flight session on 2026-08-22. `phase1_sim.launch.py`
mirrored every one of `phase1.launch.py`'s arguments and forwarded them, so:

    DeclareLaunchArgument("takeoff_alt", default_value="1.0")   # wrapper
    ...
    launch_arguments={"takeoff_alt": LaunchConfiguration("takeoff_alt")}

meant the wrapper's default was passed down and **overwrote** whatever
`phase1.launch.py` declared. `takeoff_alt` was edited to 4 m in the file that
documents it; the vehicle climbed to 1 m and nothing warned. Same for
`settle_s`, `max_rotations` and `target_bases` — the mission looked like it was
ignoring its own configuration.

Nothing needed to be mirrored. Launch configurations are inherited by an
included description, so an argument the wrapper never mentions:

  * falls through to the inner file's default when not given, and
  * still arrives from the command line when it is.

That inheritance is the load-bearing claim here, so it was checked against a
running `ros2 launch` rather than reasoned about (2026-08-22, three throwaway
launch files: a wrapper that declares and forwards `alt`, a wrapper that says
nothing, and an inner file that declares `alt` with default `INNER`):

    forwarding wrapper, no CLI argument   -> inner sees WRAPPER_DEFAULT   (the bug)
    silent wrapper,     no CLI argument   -> inner sees INNER_DEFAULT
    silent wrapper,     alt:=FROM_CLI     -> inner sees FROM_CLI

and then end to end on the real files: `phase1_sim.launch.py` with no arguments
brought the mission up at `phase1.launch.py`'s edited defaults (4.0 m, 20 turns,
9 bases), and `phase1_sim.launch.py takeoff_alt:=1.5 target_bases:=2` overrode
them. The tests below pin the structure that makes that hold; they do not
re-derive launch's scoping rules in Python.
