Pins which estimator the aircraft's life depends on.

With GPS disabled, whatever is published on /zed/zed_node/odom is relayed by
vision_odom_bridge as VISION_POSITION_ESTIMATE and *becomes* the EKF's position.
Getting this wiring wrong does not produce an error message — it produces a
vehicle that flies away.

That is not hypothetical here. Measured on the CompetionMap superflat
(2026-08-17): visual_odometry_node logged 302 starved frames (4-11 feature
matches against a 12 minimum, because the forward camera stares at bare ground)
and accumulated 0.39 m and 8.6 deg of error in 78 s **while the drone had not
moved a centimetre** — ground truth read 0.000 for all 121 samples. Arming on
that estimate, GUIDED chased a position error that did not exist until the
vehicle had travelled 26 m and flipped:

    AP: Crash: Disarming: AngErr=165>30, Accel=1.0<3.0

Hence odom_source — which defaults to the real VO, because flying on truth
would make a green simulator run prove nothing about the drone. Ground truth is
opt-in, for telling an autonomy bug apart from a localization one.

Hence also this test.
