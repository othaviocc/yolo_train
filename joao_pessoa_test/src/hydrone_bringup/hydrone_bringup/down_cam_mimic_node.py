down_cam_mimic_node — SIM-ONLY shim for the belly-mounted, down-facing camera.

Same idea as zed_mimic_node, one camera smaller: it takes what BiguaSim's bridge
publishes for the `DownCamera` sensor and re-emits it under the agnostic names
the autonomy layer subscribes to, with a proper stamp and frame.

    /biguasim/<agent>/DownCamera              ->  /down_cam/image_raw
    /biguasim/<agent>/DownCamera/camera_info  ->  /down_cam/camera_info

    TF (static):  base_link -> down_cam_link -> down_cam_optical_frame

Why the drone needs this camera at all
--------------------------------------
The ZED faces forward. It is what SPOTS a pad tens of metres ahead, but as the
drone closes in, the pad slides down and out of the forward frame precisely when
the alignment has to get tight. A nadir camera sees the pad the whole way down
and keeps seeing it while hovering over it. Detection is the same algorithm on
both — see hydrone_vision/pad_detector.py.

On the REAL drone this node does not run. A USB/CSI camera driver publishes
/down_cam/image_raw + /down_cam/camera_info directly, and a
static_transform_publisher supplies the same two TFs from the measured mount.
The contract is those two topics plus those two frames; nothing above cares who
produced them.

The mount rotation
------------------
`camera_rpy_deg` is the sensor's mounting rotation as written in BiguaSim's
config.yaml — [roll, pitch, yaw] in degrees. VERIFIED against a running UE5
render (2026-08-18, docs/Landing Sites.md's one-time check): pitch +90 aims
the lens at the GROUND. That is rotation about the body's RIGHT axis with the
right-hand rule — exactly how ROS RPY's pitch about +Y (left) moves the +X
axis: R_y(+90)·x̂ = -ẑ, straight down. The two conventions agree, so the value
carries into the ROS TF with NO sign flip. (An earlier version assumed
BiguaSim meant "+pitch = nose up" and flipped the sign; that aimed the TF at
the sky while the image showed the ground, and every down-camera detection
was refused at projection time as "ray at or above the horizon".)

The launch file reads the value straight from config.yaml so the simulated
camera and the TF can never disagree: one edit moves both.
