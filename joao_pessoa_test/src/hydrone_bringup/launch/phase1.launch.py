hydrone_bringup/launch/phase1.launch.py

AUTONOMY layer for the Phase 1 mission: take off, turn on the spot until a
landing base is in the map, fly over it, confirm it on the belly camera, land,
repeat, then come home to the base we started on.

This is an ALTERNATIVE to hydrone.launch.py and to landing_sites.launch.py, not
an addition to either. All three drive the vehicle, and running two of them puts
two nodes on /mavros/setpoint_position/local fighting over the setpoint. Pick
one.

  map_odom_tf             measured map -> odom (joins TF's two trees)
  phase1_mission          map + MAVROS   -> the flight itself

How this differs from landing_sites.launch.py
---------------------------------------------
The sensing half is identical — same two detectors, same map, same tuning — and
that is deliberate: the detector is the part that is partially validated and it
should not be forked. What changes is above it.

  * `phase1_mission_node` replaces `pad_mission_node`. The old one flies +X in
    steps and lands on whatever the belly camera happens to see; this one never
    translates without a target and searches by turning in place.
  * **Both cameras now feed the decision, in different currencies.** The old
    mission threw away every forward-camera detection. This one takes its leads
    from the MAP — built from the ZED alone — and the belly camera votes yes/no
    on what it finds there.

    The belly camera contributes NO POSITION, and that is the point. It runs
    with `project_position: False` and on its own topic, so pad_map_node never
    sees it. Its old ground-plane cast assumed a flat floor at `ground_z`, which
    the competition's RAISED bases break: from overhead the ray crosses the
    assumed plane past the pad it actually hit. And pad_map weights projections
    by `confidence / max(range, 1)`, so a confirmation hover — hundreds of
    close-range frames — would have outvoted the ZED and rewritten the very map
    entry the drone was flown there on. The ZED is the position estimate for
    everything; the belly camera answers one question, "is a base under me".
    A simpler pipeline has fewer ways to be wrong.
  * `pad_map` maps nothing until the vehicle first arms, and the base the drone
    starts on is REGISTERED rather than detected — see docs/Phase 1 Mission.md.
  * Altitude is 1 m, not 2.5 m. This is test code and a fall from 1 m is cheap.
    Note that it therefore does NOT clear the 1.5 m structure the landing_sites
    cruise altitude was chosen for: this launch assumes the Phase 1 arena is
    clear, which is the arena being flown.

Like the rest of the autonomy layer this consumes ONLY the agnostic contract
buses (/zed/zed_node/*, /down_cam/*, /mavros/*), so it is identical in sim and
on the real drone. phase1_sim adds the sources that produce those buses from
BiguaSim and passes no overrides.
