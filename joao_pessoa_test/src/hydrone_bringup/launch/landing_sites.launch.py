hydrone_bringup/launch/landing_sites.launch.py

AUTONOMY layer for the landing-site mission: fly forward, land on each pad the
down camera finds, take off again, keep going.

This is an ALTERNATIVE to hydrone.launch.py, not an addition to it. Both drive
the vehicle, and running them together would put two nodes on
/mavros/setpoint_position/local fighting over the setpoint. Pick one.

  ros2 launch hydrone_bringup landing_sites_sim.launch.py     # sim, everything
  ros2 launch hydrone_bringup landing_sites.launch.py         # autonomy only

Nodes
-----
  pad_detector (forward)  ZED RGB+depth  -> /hydrone/pads/detections
  pad_detector (down)     belly RGB      -> /hydrone/pads/detections
  pad_map                 detections     -> /hydrone/pads/map + RViz markers
  feature_map             ZED point cloud-> /hydrone/map/cloud + coverage
  map_odom_tf             static identity map -> odom (joins TF's two trees)
  pad_mission             down cam + MAVROS -> the flight itself

Like the rest of the autonomy layer this consumes ONLY the agnostic contract
buses (/zed/zed_node/*, /down_cam/*, /mavros/*), so it is identical in sim and
on the real drone — every topic below is the one the real hardware publishes,
and NOTHING here is configured differently for the simulator. landing_sites_sim
adds the sources that produce those buses from BiguaSim and passes no overrides.

It also PRODUCES only what no sensor does: pad detections and the maps built out
of them. It does not back-project depth into a point cloud any more — the ZED
publishes `/zed/zed_node/point_cloud/cloud_registered` itself, so feature_map
consumes that and spends its time on the part that is ours, the accumulation.

    # Joins TF's two disconnected trees.

    # Nobody publishes a link between `map` and `odom`, in sim or on the real
    # drone, so TF comes up as two separate trees:
    #
    #   odom -> base_link -> {zed_camera_link, down_cam_link, ...}   (VO / zed_wrapper)
    #   map  -> map_ned                                              (MAVROS static)
    #
    # Everything this launch file MAPS is published in `map`, because it is
    # built from /mavros/local_position/pose and MAVROS stamps that with
    # frame_id "map" (apm_config.yaml: local_position.frame_id). Everything it
    # SENSES lives under base_link. With no edge between them, RViz can render
    # the map or the vehicle but never both, and `tf2_echo map base_link` fails
    # with "Tf has two or more unconnected trees".
    #
    # This USED to be a static_transform_publisher broadcasting identity, on the
    # theory that `map` and `odom` coincide at boot. They do not, and the error
    # is not small: BiguaSim's odometry is NWU, vision_odom_bridge rotates it
    # +90 deg to ENU before MAVROS sees it, so `map` is ENU while the
    # odom->base_link TF stays NWU. MEASURED 2026-08-20 at two different
    # headings, /mavros/local_position/pose was Rz(+90 deg) x ground truth to
    # 0.012 m and 0.55 deg — RViz drew the vehicle 90 deg away from its own
    # point cloud, origin rotated to match.
    #
    # Identity is not even right in principle: visual_odometry_node fixes its
    # odom origin to identity at the FIRST FRAME, so `odom` is aligned to
    # whatever attitude the drone booted at. The real ZED wrapper does the same,
    # so identity would only ever hold if the vehicle happened to boot facing
    # map-east.
    #
    # map_odom_node computes the transform instead of assuming it:
    #   map_T_odom = map_T_base . (odom_T_base)^-1
    # which is how AMCL and robot_localization do it, is correct for any boot
    # heading, and needs no per-setup constant. The residual it publishes is the
    # drift between the FCU's estimate and the odometry origin — the thing
    # identity was silently declaring to be zero.
    #
    # NOT done by turning on MAVROS local_position.tf.send, which would
    # broadcast map->base_link while the VO already broadcasts odom->base_link.
    # Two parents for one frame is not a tree, and TF rejects it.
    #
    # ON THE REAL DRONE: zed_wrapper publishes map->odom ITSELF when
    # pos_tracking.publish_map_tf is true (its default), and its `map` is the
    # ZED's loop-closed frame, not the FCU's. Two broadcasters, one edge, two
    # different meanings — set publish_map_tf:=false there, or set this argument
    # false and let the ZED own it. See sources_real.launch.py.
