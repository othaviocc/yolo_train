hydrone_bringup/launch/sources_sim.launch.py

SIM SOURCES layer. Produces the agnostic contract buses from the simulation:

  /zed/zed_node/*   (sensors)   and   /mavros/*   (flight)

Everything above this layer (the autonomy stack in hydrone.launch.py) consumes
ONLY those two buses and is identical for sim and real. The real counterpart is
sources_real.launch.py — it MUST publish the same output topics listed below.

Nodes (all sim-only or agnostic plumbing):
  - ardubridge_node   : BiguaSim <-> ArduPilot SITL (PWM in / state out, JSON FDM)   [SIM-ONLY]
  - ArduPilot SITL + micro-ROS agent + MAVProxy (sitl_dds_udp.launch.py)             [SIM-ONLY]
  - zed_mimic_node    : /biguasim/* -> /zed/zed_node/* (stand-in for zed_wrapper,      [SIM-ONLY]
                        including the ZED's own point cloud)
  - down_cam_mimic_node : /biguasim/*/DownCamera -> /down_cam/* (stand-in for the     [SIM-ONLY]
                          belly camera's driver). Only launched if config-<agent>.yaml
                          declares the DownCamera sensor.
  - visual_odometry_node : ZED RGB-D -> visual odometry (stands in for the ZED       [SIM-ONLY]
                           SDK's native VIO, which zed_wrapper provides on real).
                           Whether it FLIES the vehicle or just gets measured is
                           the odom_source argument — see below.
  - mavros_node       : SITL MAVLink <-> /mavros/* (fcu_url = SITL via MAVProxy)      [agnostic role, sim fcu_url]
  - vision_odom_bridge: /zed/zed_node/odom -> /mavros/vision_pose/pose                [AGNOSTIC — also on real]
  - rangefinder_bridge: BiguaSim RangeFinderSensor -> MAVROS, and a mimic of          [SIM-ONLY shim]
                        MAVROS's own /mavros/distance_sensor/rangefinder
  - odom_error_node   : /zed/zed_node/odom vs odom_GT -> VO drift CSV at the repo     [SIM-ONLY debug]
                        root. Measurement only — publishes nothing, so it cannot
                        affect flight. Disable with odom_error:=false.

Launch arguments:
  agent_name:=<name>            which airframe, i.e. which biguasim scenario
                                file (config-<name>.yaml) everything sim-side
                                is read from            (default HolybroX500)
  odom_source:=vo|ground_truth  what the EKF navigates on             (default vo)
                                vo: the real visual odometry flies the vehicle,
                                  as the ZED SDK's VIO will on the drone. KNOWN
                                  ISSUE: on the CompetionMap superflat the
                                  forward camera sees bare ground, so the VO
                                  drifts ~0.4 m / 9 deg in 78 s WITH THE DRONE
                                  STATIONARY and the vehicle flies away on arming.
                                  That is a real defect to fix, not to bypass.
                                ground_truth: BiguaSim dynamics fly the vehicle.
                                  A DEBUGGING TOOL for isolating autonomy bugs
                                  from localization ones — a run on truth proves
                                  nothing about the real drone, which has none.
  odom_error:=true|false        run the VO drift logger            (default true)
  odom_error_print:=true|false  also echo drift to stdout at 1 Hz  (default false)
  odom_error_dir:=<path>        where the CSV goes (default: repo root, /ws in
                                the container — which is NOT bind-mounted, so
                                point this at a mounted path to keep the file)

OUTPUT CONTRACT (must match sources_real.launch.py 1:1):
  /zed/zed_node/rgb/image_rect_color, /zed/zed_node/rgb/camera_info,
  /zed/zed_node/depth/depth_registered, /zed/zed_node/depth/camera_info,
  /zed/zed_node/point_cloud/cloud_registered,
  /zed/zed_node/imu/data, /zed/zed_node/odom,
  /down_cam/image_raw, /down_cam/camera_info,
  /mavros/*  (incl. /mavros/vision_pose/pose, /mavros/distance_sensor/rangefinder)
  TF: base_link -> zed_camera_link -> zed_left_camera_frame
                                   -> zed_left_camera_optical_frame
      base_link -> down_cam_link   -> down_cam_optical_frame

  ( SIM-ONLY debug extras, NOT part of the contract the autonomy stack consumes:
    /zed/zed_node/odom_GT and /zed/zed_node/odom_VO — whichever of ground truth
    and the real VO is not currently flying the vehicle — plus
    /zed/zed_node/pose_GT, the ground-truth position AND quaternion as a plain
    PoseStamped, for answering "is the estimate wrong, or did the airframe
    actually flip?" )

  The autonomy layer above is launched with NO overrides — see
  landing_sites_sim.launch.py. Anything it would otherwise need told apart
  belongs HERE, as a mimic of what the hardware publishes.

Notes:
  - No `refs:=dds_xrce_profile.xml`: this ArduPilot creates DDS entities client-side.
  - micro_ros_agent is included by sitl_dds_udp.launch.py (don't launch a 2nd).
