image_convert — sensor_msgs/Image <-> numpy, without cv_bridge.

Why not cv_bridge
-----------------
cv_bridge's conversion runs through a compiled boost extension that is linked
against the numpy that ROS was built with (1.x on Humble). This project's
container installs numpy 2.x from pip on top of that, and the mismatch does not
fail loudly — `import cv_bridge` prints "AttributeError: _ARRAY_API not found"
and carries on, then the first `imgmsg_to_cv2` call SEGFAULTS the process.

An image message is a header plus a flat byte buffer plus an encoding string.
Reshaping that is a `np.frombuffer` away, so the C extension buys nothing here
and costs an ABI coupling that can take a node down mid-flight. zed_mimic_node
already reads depth this way for the same reason.

Only the encodings this stack actually moves are supported, and anything else
raises rather than guessing — a silently mis-decoded image is far worse than a
loud one.
