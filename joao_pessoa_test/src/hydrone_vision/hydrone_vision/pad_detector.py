pad_detector — classic (non-learned) detection of the competition landing pad.

TWO PADS, TWO WAYS OF FINDING THEM
----------------------------------
BiguaSim's pad is a strongly saturated BLUE field carrying a YELLOW ring and
cross, sitting on brown-green ground. Nothing else in the map is that blue, so
"find the blue blob, then prove it carries a ring and a cross" works, and
`field_mode="blue"` does exactly that.

The REAL pad does not work that way.

    SIM                          REAL
    +-----------------+          +=================+  <- yellow square border
    |     .-----.     |          I     .-----.     I
    |    /   |   \    |          I    /   |   \    I     field: blue, SAME HUE

    |     '-----'     |          I     '-----'     I             +cross
    +-----------------+          +=================+
     blue field                   BLUE FOAM FLOOR all around
     brown ground around

It lies on interlocking blue foam of the same hue as its own field, and it
carries a yellow square border the simulated pad does not have. There is no
"blue blob" to find: the pad and the floor are one blue region.

WHY ABSOLUTE COLOUR CANNOT FIND IT
----------------------------------
Measured off the arena photographs and off the ZED's own frames, 2026-08-22:

                       H          S          V
    floor, phone      109        142        193
    floor, ZED        103-105    220        190
    pad field, phone  107        104        158
    pad field, ZED    101        172        146
    markings, phone    25        218        254
    markings, ZED      58         44        196

The MARKINGS are not yellow to the ZED. Under the arena's lighting its auto
white balance throws a heavy green cast and its exposure washes the paint out:
H 58 (green), S 44. The yellow band this file uses for the simulator is
H 18..38, S >= 110, and against a real ZED frame it admits ZERO pixels. Since
`detect()` reaches the ring, cross and concentricity checks only through the
yellow mask, an empty yellow mask means the cascade never runs at all.

The FIELD moves further than any band is wide. Floor saturation is 142 in one
camera and 220 in the other; the pad's own field is 104 and 172. A band cut to
separate them in one frame merges them in the other.

Nor is the floor separable by colour. Raw ZED capture, 2026-08-23, has a global
BLUE cast, and in it the white wall reads more blue-dominant than the far mat
(opponent -39 against -28). An earlier version of this mode gated on "the pad
must lie on blue-dominant floor"; measured across 44 labelled frames that gate
selected 80-94% of every frame, walls included. It has been removed rather than
retuned: there is no threshold that separates a blue-lit wall from blue foam.

WHAT THE REAL MODE USES INSTEAD
-------------------------------
1. MARKINGS, by CONTRAST rather than by hue. Take the opponent channel

       yb = (R + G)/2 - B

   and subtract its own local mean over a large box. Blue floor and blue field
   both sit far below their neighbourhood; paint sits above it. This is a
   colour DIFFERENCE measured against a LOCAL reference, so a white-balance
   shift, an exposure change, or the slow horizontal banding the ZED shows
   under the arena's lights all move signal and reference together and cancel.

2. HYPOTHESES, as ELLIPSES. Every candidate is an ellipse, because the pad's
   circle under perspective is one and because an ellipse carries the
   foreshortening that a circular model throws away. They come from two places,
   since the pad is two different things at the two ranges that matter:

     RING FIT     the circle resolves as its own marking component. Fitting an
                  ellipse to it puts the centre exactly on the pad. This is the
                  belly camera at landing height.
     CLUSTER FIT  everything -- border, ring, cross -- merges into one small
                  patch, which is the forward ZED across the arena. The ring
                  cannot be isolated, so the ellipse is fitted to the whole
                  cluster instead. Coarser, but it still carries the
                  foreshortening.

   The link distance that decides what clusters with what cannot be derived
   from the frame -- it scales with the pad, and the pad is what we are looking
   for -- so the clustering runs at three radii and overlap suppression settles
   it. A ring fit outranks a cluster fit over the same pad (`ring_bonus`),
   because the winner is the position that gets projected into the world.

3. ONE VERIFIER, in the candidate ellipse's own normalised coordinates. Sweep
   72 rays out to normalised radius 1.25 and ask the same three questions the
   simulator's checks ask, but scaled by the ellipse rather than by a circle:

     ring_cov  fraction of rays that meet any marking. A ring -> ~1.0.
     arms      angular lobes of marking between 0.25 and 0.55 of the OUTERMOST
               marking found along each ray. The cross gives four. A solid
               patch gives one, a bare ring none. Measuring against each ray's
               own outer radius is what lets the same band work whether the
               outermost marking is the square border or the circle -- which is
               why this mode needs no separate handling for the border, and why
               the ROI no longer has to be shrunk to hide it.
     seen      fraction of the sweep that stayed inside the image. The belly
               camera at landing height sees a pad whose centre is off-frame;
               the forward camera never should. It is a per-camera threshold,
               not a gate with one right value.

4. THE FIELD IS DARKER THAN THE MAT. A pad is dark ground carrying bright
   paint, lying on lighter foam, so median(inside) - median(outside) over
   non-marking pixels is negative for a pad under any illumination -- two
   medians from the same frame, so a colour cast cancels. Measured over the
   labelled frames: every pad -25..-2, while the bright window lattice that
   was outranking pads sits at +7..+95.

5. STRENGTH. `mark_delta` is set low so faint far-away paint still enters the
   mask; this asks how far the markings actually cleared it. Real paint clears
   it wide, a stain only just does.

6. AIRFRAME. A fixed-mount camera sees parts of the drone. The belly camera's
   landing legs intrude at two corners and score up to 0.95 -- a dark object
   with a bright edge on blue foam is, to every test above, a small pad.
   Nothing in one frame separates them, so `ignore_regions` blanks them by
   position. It is empty by default and must be measured per airframe.

Why not just "find the markings"
--------------------------------
Anything pale on a blue mat would pass: a scuff, a cable, a reflection. The
structure IS the identity of the pad, so the detector spends most of its effort
proving that a cluster of paint really is a concentric ring and cross, and
reports a confidence built from those checks rather than a bare yes/no.

MEASURED, ON 44 LABELLED FRAMES FROM THE ARENA
----------------------------------------------
Two ZED clips and two belly-camera clips, 2026-08-23, hand-labelled. Scored on
whether the BEST-RANKED detection is the pad, which is what the mission acts on:

                    top-1   mis-ranked   missed   on empty frames
    shipped before   8/42        4         30            0
    this version    32/42        3          7            1

The belly camera is 18/18 with nothing mis-ranked. The forward camera is 14/24;
what it misses is the pad seen almost edge-on at the far wall, 9:1 foreshortened
and a few thousand pixels in area.

Raising the caller's threshold to 0.70 trades recall for accuracy exactly as it
should: 26/42, one mis-ranked, and centre error p90 falls from 72 px to 52 px.
That is deliberate -- see `ecc_penalty`.

KNOWN CONFUSERS
---------------
Three things in the arena pass every check here, and none can be separated from
a pad by appearance in a single frame:

  A SOLAR PANEL leaning on the wall: blue, rectangular, ruled with a pale grid.
  A CABLE lying on the mat in a loop: a pale closed curve on blue.
  THE DRONE'S OWN LEGS in the belly camera (handled by `ignore_regions`).

For the first two the discriminator is geometry, not appearance -- both are off
the floor plane or lack a cross -- and the forward camera already has depth. A
ground-plane gate on the back-projected point in pad_detector_node is the right
place for it. NOT IMPLEMENTED. docs/Pad Detector.md has the measurements.

This module is deliberately ROS-free: it takes a BGR ndarray and returns
dataclasses. pad_detector_node.py wraps it; test_pad_detector.py exercises it
directly against synthetic renders and against measurements from the arena.
