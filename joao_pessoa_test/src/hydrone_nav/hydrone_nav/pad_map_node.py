"""
pad_map_node — the drone's memory of where the landing pads are.

Detections arrive as a stream of independent, noisy, per-frame guesses from two
cameras. This node turns that stream into a small persistent map: one entry per
physical pad, with a fused position, a height, and — critically — a flag saying
whether the drone has already landed on it.

That flag is what makes "land, take off, keep going" a mission rather than a
loop: without it the drone re-detects the pad it is standing on and lands on it
again forever.

    /hydrone/pads/detections  (PadDetection, many per second, from N cameras)
              |
              |  gate -> associate -> fuse -> prune
              v
    /hydrone/pads/map         (PadMap, the whole map on every change)
    /hydrone/pads/markers     (MarkerArray, the same thing for RViz)

Fusion
------
Nearest-neighbour association inside `merge_radius`, then a weighted running
mean of x and y. The weight is `confidence / max(range, 1)`, so a close-up look
from the down camera at 2 m outvotes a speck seen 20 m ahead — which is the
right ordering, because projection error grows with range in both routes
(depth noise linearly, ground-plane error with the ray's obliqueness).

Heights
-------
Pads sit at WHATEVER HEIGHT THEY SIT AT. There is no gate on a detection's z:
the competition's bases are at different elevations, and the drone may take off
from one of them, which puts every other pad at a negative z in the FCU's local
frame. Rejecting on height threw those away — the detector saw them and the map
refused them. A bad depth sample now costs a provisional entry that fails to
reach min_observations and is pruned, which is what that gate already does.

A detection's z comes from a flat-floor assumption, so every pad initially maps
at floor level. The arena has an elevated base (~0.5 m), and landing on it needs
its real height. The fix costs nothing extra: whenever the drone hovers within
`overhead_radius` of a mapped pad, the downward rangefinder is measuring the top
of THAT pad, so `height = drone_z - range` and the entry is corrected in place.
Until then `height_measured` stays false and the mission descends cautiously.

Motion
------
Detections are mapped ONLY while the vehicle is holding still. A projection is
composed with the vehicle pose, and while translating or slewing that pose is
stale by however long the estimator lags, so the pad lands in the map metres
from where it really is — the "strange detections while moving" that then cost
the search a leg to fly out and rule out. The search already works in
rotate/settle/look steps, so the still moments are the ones worth believing and
nothing is lost by ignoring the rest.

Pruning
-------
A pad seen once and never again was a false positive. Entries below
`min_observations` that have not been re-seen within `provisional_ttl_s` are
dropped. Confirmed, visited and takeoff-base entries are never pruned —
forgetting where you landed would undo the whole point.

The takeoff base
----------------
The drone always starts standing ON a base, and it is not one of the sites it is
meant to land on. Two things follow, and both are handled here rather than in
the mission:

  * **Nothing is mapped before the first arm.** On the ground the belly camera
    is a few centimetres above that base and the forward camera is looking along
    it at a grazing angle, which is exactly the geometry that produces a
    detection of the start base. Mapping it then would seed a candidate the
    mission has to fly to and rule out. `require_armed` (default true) drops
    every detection until /mavros/state first reports armed.
  * **It is declared, not detected.** `RegisterTakeoffBase` is called the
    instant the drone arms, with the position it is standing at. That entry
    carries `is_takeoff_base`, is never pruned, is never offered as a landing
    candidate, and claims later detections within `takeoff_base_radius` so a
    glancing view of it from the air cannot spawn a phantom pad beside it.

Registering costs nothing and is certain. The alternative — letting the detector
find the start base later and having the mission hover over it to decide — spends
a travel leg and a confirmation hover, and every second of both is accumulated
visual-odometry drift, on a question that was already answered.
