feature_map_node — a world map accumulated from the ZED's point cloud.

The pad map (pad_map_node) records the few things the drone wants to land on.
This node records everything else it has looked at: the ZED's own registered
point cloud, sampled on a stride grid, folded into the world frame and
accumulated in a voxel grid, plus a 2-D grid of how thoroughly each patch of
floor has been observed.

Why it does not back-project depth itself
-----------------------------------------
It used to: it read `depth/depth_registered` plus `rgb/camera_info` and turned
pixels into 3-D points. That is the CAMERA's job, and the ZED already does it —
`point_cloud/cloud_registered` comes straight out of the SDK on the drone. Doing
it again up here meant this node held a second, slightly different copy of the
camera's geometry, and it meant the simulator was NOT reproducing a product the
real hardware publishes. The back-projection now lives where the camera lives:
zed_mimic_node in sim, zed_wrapper on the drone. This node consumes the cloud in
both, and cannot tell them apart.

What this node still owns is the part no ZED produces: ACCUMULATION into a
persistent world map, and the coverage grid. Those are ours, so they stay in the
autonomy layer and run identically in sim and on the drone.

Why depth and not ORB features
------------------------------
This node used to key the map on ORB keypoints, and on the competition arena
that produced nothing usable. MEASURED on a live sim frame (2026-08-20), drone
on the ground facing the maze wall at 4.86 m:

    ORB keypoints found:  46  (of a 400 cap)
    their v range:        216..246 of 480 rows

Every keypoint landed in a 30-pixel band. The arena is matte white wall on
blown-out white floor under a smooth sky, so the only intensity gradient in the
frame is the horizon line — ORB has nothing else to grip. The map was a
horizontal line of points, never a surface.

Worse, a corner detector puts its keypoints exactly ON depth discontinuities,
which is the single worst place to sample a depth image. The wall sits at
4.86 m, but the depth under those 46 keypoints ranged 5.36..18.07 m: each ORB
patch straddles wall-and-background, so the rounded pixel returns the wall or
whatever is behind it, essentially at random. Those are "flying pixels", and
they are why the old cloud looked like noise rather than a wall.

Depth pixels have the opposite bias — they are dense exactly where surfaces are
— so the map now samples the ZED's cloud on a stride grid and explicitly REJECTS
the discontinuities that ORB used to seek out. See `_edge_mask`. That rejection
is why the cloud has to arrive ORGANIZED (height x width, one point per pixel):
a flattened cloud has no pixel neighbours left to compare against.

Why this and not the VO node
----------------------------
hydrone_bringup/visual_odometry_node also consumes this camera — but it is in
the flight-critical loop: the FCU navigates on its output with GPS disabled, so
anything added there can cost the vehicle its position estimate. This node is a
pure consumer. It subscribes, it never publishes a pose, and it holds no TF, so
the worst it can do when it misbehaves is use CPU.

What the coverage grid is for
-----------------------------
It answers "where have I actually looked?", which is the question a search has to
ask before it can claim there is nothing left to find. It is published for the
operator and for RViz; the mission's search pattern does NOT consume it yet —
pad_mission_node flies a fixed bounded spiral. Feeding coverage back into the
planner (skip a leg that is already well seen, re-fly one that is not) is the
natural next step and is deliberately left out until the fixed pattern has been
flown end to end.

The map is only as good as the pose it is folded into. This node reads the ZED's
odometry, so any drift in it smears the map by exactly that much — it does not
and cannot correct for it. TF is consulted only for the constant camera mount —
looked up against whatever frame_id the cloud arrives stamped with, so the
wrapper's choice of frame (the real one publishes the cloud in the left camera's
robot-convention frame, the images in its optical child) is not something this
node has to be told.

The pose comes from the ZED's odometry rather than the FCU because the ZED
produces exactly one pose per camera frame, carrying that frame's own
timestamp — so each cloud is folded in with the attitude it was actually
captured at. See the `odom_topic` parameter for the measurements behind
that choice. The cloud is published in the odometry's frame (`odom`), which is
continuous; `map` steps whenever the EKF corrects and would tear the cloud at
every correction. map_odom_node publishes map->odom for display in `map`.
