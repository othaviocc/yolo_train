phase1_mission_node — spin, look, land, repeat.

The Phase 1 flight for the 5x5 m arena. The drone starts on a base in a corner,
and the sites it must land on are somewhere in the square with it. There is
nowhere to fly TO before looking, so this mission does not fly a pattern at all:
it takes off, turns on the spot, and only ever translates once it has something
to translate towards.

    arm  ->  register the base under us as the takeoff base
         ->  take off to takeoff_alt
         ->  is a confirmed, unvisited, non-takeoff base in the map?
                 yes -> fly over it -> confirm on the belly camera
                          confirmed -> LAND, mark visited, take off, repeat
                          not confirmed -> blacklist it, resume searching
                 no  -> turn 45 deg CW, settle, look again
                          8 turns with nothing -> the fallback
         ->  once `target_bases` landings are done: fly to the takeoff base,
             land on it, DONE.

Why turning instead of flying a pattern
---------------------------------------
Every metre flown is visual-odometry drift, and the arena gives the VO very
little to work with (docs/Landing Sites.md, and the ORB survey that found 46
keypoints in a whole frame). A 5x5 m square is small enough that a camera at
1 m sees all of it from one spot given enough headings, so the cheapest search
is the one that does not move the vehicle: turn, look, turn. The only
translation in the whole mission is the leg to a base the drone has already
decided to land on.

Why the pause matters
---------------------
Detection runs continuously — the detectors know nothing about this node — but
the mission only ACTS on detections that were taken while the vehicle was
stationary. A pad seen mid-turn is projected through a yaw estimate that is
still slewing, and lands in the map metres from the real thing. Yaw has to be
settled and held for `settle_s` before the map is read. That is also why the
pause is short: it is long enough for the estimate to stop moving, not long
enough to accumulate meaningful drift standing still.

Why the takeoff base is declared, not detected
----------------------------------------------
The base the drone starts on is a rectangle with a circular hole rather than the
disc-with-ring of a real landing site, but it carries the same colours and the
same cross, and from an oblique angle the detector does sometimes call it. Left
alone it would become a map candidate, and ruling it out would cost a travel leg
and a confirmation hover — drift spent on a question already answered. So the
instant the vehicle arms, its own position is registered as the takeoff base
(`RegisterTakeoffBase`), and pad_map_node refuses to map anything at all before
that arm. See docs/Phase 1 Mission.md.

Speed
-----
There is no setpoint stepping here. One setpoint per leg, and the speed is the
FCU's business: WPNAV_SPEED / WPNAV_ACCEL bound the translation and ATC_SLEW_YAW
bounds the turn, all set in config/params/holybro_sitl.parm. Chopping a 2 m leg
into pieces would not make the vehicle gentler — the position controller already
accelerates against its own limits — it would only add arrival tests, each with
its own tolerance, on an estimate that is the least trustworthy thing in the
stack. Takeoff speed is deliberately NOT touched; the existing climb is fine.

      /hydrone/pads/mark_visited, /hydrone/pads/register_takeoff_base

Dry run — `dry_run:=true`, and phase1_dry.launch.py
---------------------------------------------------
The same state machine, the same map, the same belly camera, and NOTHING SENT
TO THE FLIGHT CONTROLLER. A human carries the drone and is the actuator: the
node prints `>>> RAISE …`, `>>> TURN … 45 deg`, `>>> CARRY … 2.4 m`, `>>> PUT
IT DOWN`, and every transition still waits on the MEASURED pose, so the
rehearsal advances only when the drone has physically been moved. It exists
because the mission is worth debugging in the arena, against the real pads and
the real estimate, without motors — a spinning propeller in someone's hands is
the one failure this whole file must never produce.

What makes that structural rather than a promise: the arm, mode and takeoff
CLIENTS and the setpoint PUBLISHER are never created (see the I/O section), so
no path through this node reaches the FCU — including one added later by
someone who did not read this. `_start_call`, `_set_mode` and `_stream` all
refuse on None, so a forgotten guard is a log line rather than a command.

This is a guarantee about THIS STACK, not about the vehicle. MAVROS runs
normally, /mavros/cmd/arming still exists for anyone who types one, and the
transmitter never went through MAVROS at all. Arming is settled at the flight
controller: set an arming check the vehicle cannot pass before a rehearsal, and
take the props off. `_dry_audit` checks the one thing it usefully can — that
nothing ELSE in the graph is publishing setpoints, which is what a forgotten
phase1_real in another terminal looks like.

What still happens, because it is the point: the pretend-arm registers the
takeoff base, that opens pad_map_node's gate, and the map, its markers and the
feature map build from there exactly as they would in flight.
