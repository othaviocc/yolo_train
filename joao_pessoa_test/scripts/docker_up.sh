# Bring up the full simulation stack in Docker.
#
# Usage: scripts/docker_up.sh [--dev] [--no-build] [--phase1] [--landing-sites]
#                             [--phase4] [--ground-truth] [--no-odom-print]
#                             [--world HOST[:PORT]] [--world-port PORT]
#                             [name:=value ...] [docker compose up args...]
#   --dev             mount the project packages from the host into the
#                     container (docker-compose.dev.yml) and skip the image
#                     build. Node code, launch files and config YAML are then
#                     live — edit, `docker compose restart hydrone`, done.
#                     Use scripts/dev_rebuild.sh for .msg / setup.py / new-file
#                     changes. Implies --no-build.
#   --no-build        don't pass --build to compose (reuse the current image).
#   --phase1          run the Phase 1 mission (take off, turn on the spot until
#                     a landing base is found, fly over it, confirm it on the
#                     belly camera, land, repeat, come home) instead of the bare
#                     sim bring-up. See docs/Phase 1 Mission.md.
#   --landing-sites   run the earlier landing-site mission (fly forward and land
#                     on whatever the belly camera sees). See docs/Landing Sites.md.
#   --phase4          bring up the OTHER AIRCRAFT: the Kopis X8 flying on its
#                     Livox Mid-360 (config-KopisX8.yaml, an engine raycast
#                     lidar). FAST-LIO odometry is the EKF's external nav; the
#                     persistent map node runs too. Local simulator only.
#                     --ground-truth and --no-odom-print don't apply.
#                     See phase4_sim.launch.py and docs/LIO Odometry.md.
#   --ground-truth    fly the EKF on BiguaSim ground truth instead of the real
#                     visual odometry (odom_source:=ground_truth). A DEBUGGING
#                     AID for separating autonomy bugs from localization bugs —
#                     a green run on ground truth proves nothing about the real
#                     drone, which has none. See docs/Landing Sites.md.
#   --no-odom-print   silence odom_error_node's 1 Hz VO-drift line (the CSV is
#                     still written either way). On by default.
#   --world HOST[:PORT]
#                     fly against a BiguaSim world running in ANOTHER process,
#                     instead of starting the simulator in this container.
#                     SITL and the whole autonomy stack still run here; only the
#                     physics, the sensor rendering and the collision checking
#                     move. Several machines can then share one simulation and
#                     SEE each other in it, which a local sim cannot do.
#                     PORT defaults to 8770 (the world's request port; it also
#                     uses PORT+1 to publish state).
#                     Start the world with, on the other machine:
#                       python tools/serve_world.py --package Competition \
#                              --world CompetionMap --port 8770
#   --world-port PORT the same port, given separately. Handy for an IPv6
#                     literal, where HOST:PORT is ambiguous.
#
# Running against a world needs the world PACKAGE installed here too
# (~/.local/share/biguasim, already bind-mounted): the client refuses to connect
# unless its copy of the world matches the server's, because mismatched
# collision geometry looks like broken physics rather than a version problem.
#
# Any argument containing ':=' is a LAUNCH argument and is appended to the
# ros2 launch command inside the container, so the mission can be tuned without
# editing a file:
#
#   scripts/docker_up.sh --phase1 target_bases:=2 takeoff_alt:=1.5
#
# --phase1, --landing-sites and --phase4 all pick the launch file, so they are
# mutually exclusive; the last one given wins.
# Anything else is forwarded untouched to `docker compose up` (-d, --force-recreate, ...).
