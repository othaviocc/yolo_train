# rviz2 on THIS machine, looking at the topics the drone is publishing.
#
#   ./scripts/rviz_remote.sh                 # markers, TF, pose
#   ./scripts/rviz_remote.sh -d my.rviz      # with a saved config
#   ./scripts/rviz_remote.sh --wifi          # force the wifi
#
# WHY NOT ON THE JETSON
# rviz2 is deliberately not in the drone's image. A Tegra X1 renders it badly,
# and forwarding its window over ssh -X pushes a whole framebuffer across the
# same wifi link as everything else. Running it here instead sends only the
# messages, and the ones you want from a drone -- markers, TF, pose, the pad
# map -- are tiny.
#
# DO NOT add /zed/.../image_rect_color or point_cloud/cloud_registered to an
# rviz display over wifi. 640x480 BGR at 15 Hz is ~110 Mbit/s and the point
# cloud is worse; it will starve the link the drone is also using for MAVLink.
# Use rqt_image_view on a single topic if you need to see a camera, or better,
# look at the debug images on the drone's own screen.
#
# When the link ends up being the cable that warning is largely lifted: the
# direct 10.10.0.0/24 gigabit link is dedicated, so a camera display costs the
# drone's wifi nothing. The point cloud is still a lot of data for rviz itself
# to draw. The line this script prints on startup says which link you got, and
# it repeats the warning whenever that link is the wifi.
#
# ── WHICH LINK ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#   --auto  (default)   the cable if it is plugged in and carrying a link, the
#                       wifi otherwise. jetson_up.sh defaults to --auto too and
#                       tests the same physical fact, so both ends decide alike
#                       without anyone typing a flag.
#   --cable             insist on the direct cable
#   --wifi              insist on the wireless interface
#   --any               no pinning; whatever DDS negotiates (old behaviour)
#
# An explicit --cable requires jetson_up.sh --cable on the other end, or
# nothing is publishing there and rviz shows an empty scene with no error --
# the reason the default measures the link instead. See scripts/dds_iface.sh.
#
# DOMAIN IDS HAVE TO MATCH, and the two halves of this project do not agree by
# default: docker-compose.yml sets ROS_DOMAIN_ID=42 for the simulator, while
# scripts/jetson_up.sh leaves it unset, which DDS reads as 0. Set ROS_DOMAIN_ID
# the same on both sides -- here and in jetson_up.sh's environment -- or rviz
# will sit there showing nothing with no error at all.
#
# Verified 2026-08-23: PC 192.168.0.103 received a topic published by a
# container on the Jetson 192.168.0.102 over wifi, on domain 0.
