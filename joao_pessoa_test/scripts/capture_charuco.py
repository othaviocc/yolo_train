"""Capture ChArUco views for an OFFLINE calibration. No GUI, no ROS.

    python3 scripts/capture_charuco.py --out /repo/calib_images

Why this exists: `cameracalibrator` does capture and solve in one GUI process,
on the machine holding the camera. On a Tegra X1 the solve is the problem --
measured at 18+ minutes and still running, with the GUI frozen throughout
because camera_calibrator.py:298 calls do_calibration() straight from the mouse
callback, on the same thread as cv2.imshow.

Splitting the two puts the slow half on a fast machine and, more importantly,
keeps the IMAGES. A GUI calibration that goes wrong has to be re-waved from
scratch; a directory of frames can be re-solved as often as you like.

Coverage is what makes a calibration good, so this tracks it explicitly instead
of asking you to watch four bars: it bins each detected view by where the board
sits in frame, how much of the frame it fills, and how far it is tilted, and it
only keeps a frame that lands in a bin still short of views. That is the same
idea as the GUI's X/Y/Size/Skew bars, printed as a table.
