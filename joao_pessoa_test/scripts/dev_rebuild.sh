# Rebuild the project packages inside the ALREADY RUNNING container.
#
# Usage: scripts/dev_rebuild.sh [--restart] [package ...]
#   --restart   restart the hydrone service afterwards so the new code runs
#               (needed for anything but a pure edit to an already-loaded file)
#   package...  packages to rebuild; default is all project packages
#
# This is the companion to `scripts/docker_up.sh --dev`. With the dev bind
# mounts in place, most edits (node code, existing launch files, existing
# config YAML) are already live and need nothing but a restart. Run this when
# you changed something the symlink chain can't pick up:
#
#   * .msg files in hydrone_msgs / biguasim_interfaces
#   * entry_points / data_files in setup.py
#   * files that did not exist at image-build time (new launch or config file)
#
# It writes to the container's writable layer, so the result survives
# `docker compose stop/start` and `restart` but NOT `docker compose down`.
# After a `down`, either rerun this once or rebuild the image normally.
