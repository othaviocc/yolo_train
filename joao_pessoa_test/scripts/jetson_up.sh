#
# ── --dry: REHEARSING THE MISSION WITH NOBODY IN DANGER ─────────────────────
# Everything the normal run starts — both cameras, MAVROS, both detectors, the
# pad map and its markers, the feature map, the mission itself — with NO
# command ever reaching the flight controller. You carry the drone and are the
# actuator: the mission prints `>>> RAISE ...`, `>>> TURN ... 45 deg`,
# `>>> CARRY ... 2.3 m`, `>>> PUT IT DOWN`, and each transition waits on the
# MEASURED pose, so it only advances once you have actually moved the drone.
#
# The mission sends nothing, and that is structural rather than a promise: in
# dry run it never CREATES its arm/mode/takeoff clients or its setpoint
# publisher, so no code path in it reaches the FCU -- including one added later
# by somebody who never read this.
#
# THAT IS A GUARANTEE ABOUT THE STACK, NOT ABOUT THE VEHICLE. MAVROS runs
# normally and still offers /mavros/cmd/arming to anyone who types one, and the
# transmitter never went through MAVROS at all. BEFORE A REHEARSAL, SET AN
# ARMING CHECK THE VEHICLE CANNOT PASS, AND TAKE THE PROPS OFF. Ten seconds in
# the mission does check the one thing it usefully can -- that nothing ELSE in
# the graph is publishing setpoints, i.e. that you have not left phase1_real
# running in another terminal.
#
# --sources is NOT this. It starts the hardware and nothing above it: no
# detector, no map, no mission. It answers "do the cameras and the FCU link
# work", which is a different question.
#
# This is the Jetson's answer to scripts/docker_up.sh. It is a plain `docker
# run` and not compose because the board has neither `docker compose` nor
# `docker-compose` installed, and putting them there to launch one container is
# not worth the disk.
#
# ── WHY YOU ALMOST NEVER REBUILD ────────────────────────────────────────────
# The project packages are bind-mounted from the checkout over /ws/src/<pkg>,
# the same trick as docker-compose.dev.yml. The image was built with
# `colcon build --symlink-install`, which chains
#
#   install/<pkg>/.../<pkg>  ->  /ws/build/<pkg>  ->  /ws/src/<pkg>/<pkg>
#
# so mounting the working tree at the end of that chain makes node code,
# existing launch files and existing config YAML live. Edit on the Jetson (or
# rsync to it), re-run this script, and the new code runs. No image build, no
# colcon, no layer cache to think about.
#
# WHAT IS *NOT* LIVE, and needs --rebuild (colcon inside the container):
#   * .msg / .srv changes in hydrone_msgs      (code generation)
#   * new entry_points in setup.py             (console-script wrappers)
#   * new package.xml dependencies
#
# A launch file or a config YAML that did not exist at image-build time USED to
# be on that list -- --symlink-install links one file at a time, at build time,
# so a new one has nothing pointing at it. This script now recreates those two
# symlinks itself on every run (see _relink below), which is what colcon would
# have done and takes milliseconds instead of a rebuild. Existing links are
# never touched, so it cannot hide a stale build.
#
# --rebuild does not persist: the container is --rm, so its writable layer goes
# away with it. Pass --rebuild on each run until the change is worth a --build.
#
# WHAT NEEDS --build (a real image build): a new apt/pip dependency, a new SDK,
# or anything else in Dockerfile.jetson. The expensive layers (apt, MAVROS, the
# ZED SDK, pyzed) all sit ABOVE the `COPY src/` line, so they stay cached and
# only the colcon layer is redone.
#
# ── WHICH LINK THE TOPICS GO OUT ON ─────────────────────────────────────────
# The board is on two networks: the shared wifi, and a direct gigabit cable to
# the workstation on 10.10.0.0/24 (this end is 10.10.0.2, statically assigned).
# Fast DDS announces a locator for EVERY interface it can see and then uses
# whichever the peer answers on, so without pinning, camera topics go out over
# the wifi the drone is also flying MAVLink on -- ~110 Mbit/s for one 640x480
# BGR stream at 15 Hz.
#
#   --auto  (default)   use the cable if it is plugged in and carrying a link,
#                       otherwise the wifi. view_remote.sh and rviz_remote.sh
#                       default to --auto too, and carrier is a property of the
#                       CABLE rather than of either host, so both ends measure
#                       the same fact and agree without being told -- even
#                       though this one starts long before they do.
#   --cable             insist on the direct cable, leaving the wifi for
#                       MAVLink. Fails loudly if it is not there.
#   --wifi              insist on wlan0. An actual flight with nothing
#                       tethered, or a cable you want ignored.
#   --any               no pinning; whatever DDS negotiates (old behaviour).
#
# IMPORTANT, AND THE REASON --auto EXISTS: --cable with the cable unplugged
# fails loudly here, but --cable on one end and --wifi on the other does NOT.
# That combination looks exactly like a domain-id mismatch -- the viewer sits
# there with an empty window and no error. Two humans typing matching flags on
# two machines is the failure mode; --auto removes the typing. It still cannot
# save you from --cable HERE and --wifi THERE, typed deliberately.
#
# Shared memory is kept in all modes, so nodes inside this container still talk
# to each other over SHM rather than the network stack. Only the OFF-BOARD path
# is pinned. See scripts/dds_iface.sh.
